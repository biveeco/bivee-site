# the list of projects and their metadata
# -> used to construct pages for each case study, based on 'project' template and markdown files in 'work' folders
# -> title.long is the main headline for the case study, and should be descriptive/editorial
# -> title.short is a short version of the title used to refer to the project in the UI/navigation. Usually just the project name (e.g. PPP Knowledge Lab) is good.
# -> title.subtitle is a descriptive/editorial subhead that should be displayed on the case study page. This is helpful if the client logo and long title don't make the project name obvious.
