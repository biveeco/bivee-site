  <p>We’re specialists in strategy, branding, design, communications, knowledge management, and technology. We use these skills in our consulting engagements and in the development of new products and applications.</p>
  <p>By applying design thinking to various situations (from relatively simple to super complex), across diverse sectors (healthcare, learning, disaster management, public-private partnerships, infrastructure), for diverse needs (technology, innovation, knowledge management, branding, communications) we’ve helped our clients (NGOs, private sector businesses, international development organizations) achieve better outcomes than they thought possible.</p>

# the list of projects and their metadata
# -> used to construct pages for each case study, based on 'project' template and markdown files in 'work' folders
# -> title.long is the main headline for the case study, and should be descriptive/editorial
# -> title.short is a short version of the title used to refer to the project in the UI/navigation. Usually just the project name (e.g. PPP Knowledge Lab) is good.
# -> title.subtitle is a descriptive/editorial subhead that should be displayed on the case study page. This is helpful if the client logo and long title don't make the project name obvious.
