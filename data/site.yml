  headline: We're changing our name!
  blurb: |-
    We've grown a lot since we started in 2013, and our work has evolved as well. This year, after a period of rethinking our brand and our approach, we decided to change our name to better reflect where we're headed. Our new name is **H&oslash;st**.

    We'll be rolling out our new brand over the next few months, and updating our website alongside it. Check back here soon for more on the thinking and process behind it.

  intro: |-
    H&oslash;st means _harvest_ in Danish. To us, this means producing something new and vital &mdash; with a lot of hard work. It means going back to basics, finding ways to be more efficient and direct, and working toward a shared goal with a close-knit a team.

    In the design-agency world, a trend has emerged where a single company tries to do everything: the so-called "360" service model. We offer a different approach. We value focus. We define the problem and search for the simplest solution. We walk around it, scrutinize it, dig until we've found the root. Sometimes we have to change direction. Often we have to say no to other possibilities.

    We want to make the world's best digital products and brands, and we want to work for social good. If this sounds like you, we can't wait to get started.
