  <p>We’re specialists in strategy, branding, design, communications, knowledge management, and technology. We use these skills in our consulting engagements and the development of new products and applications.</p>
  <p>We’ve taken this approach on projects in development, healthcare, and education, among others, and with a wide variety of partners, from international development organisations to nonprofits and private sector firms.</p>

# the list of projects and their metadata
# -> used to construct pages for each case study, based on 'project' template and markdown files in 'work' folders
# -> title.long is the main headline for the case study, and should be descriptive/editorial
# -> title.short is a short version of the title used to refer to the project in the UI/navigation. Usually just the project name (e.g. PPP Knowledge Lab) is good.
# -> title.subtitle is a descriptive/editorial subhead that should be displayed on the case study page. This is helpful if the client logo and long title don't make the project name obvious.
