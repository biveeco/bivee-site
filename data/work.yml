# the list of projects and their metadata
# -> used to construct pages for each case study, based on 'project' template and markdown files in 'work' folders
# -> title.long is the main headline for the case study, and should be descriptive/editorial
# -> title.short is a short version of the title used to refer to the project in the UI/navigation. Usually just the project name (e.g. PPP Knowledge Lab) is good.
# -> title.subtitle is a descriptive/editorial subhead that should be displayed on the case study page. This is helpful if the client logo and long title don't make the project name obvious.

  title: Pro-bono work
  body: |-
    Doing work we believe in – work that helps people, in one way or another – is the reason we started Bivee, and the reason we show up for work every day. We’re lucky because we’re often able to work with organizations that not only have great missions but also have the funding to build their visions at scale. Those stars tend to align only at a certain point in an organization’s growth, however, and many less-established teams have a much harder time of it.

    If that’s you, we want to help. Bivee regularly does pro-bono projects as a way of building relationships with teams that we may not ordinarily be able to work with. We find it’s also a great way to explore new ideas and learn about new contexts. Here’s how it works:

    - We’re currently able to schedule **3** pro-bono projects each year.
    - Each project has a budget of **50 hours** of work and must be self-contained: it can completed, from green-light to approval, within the budget.
    - We pursue projects that offer opportunities to **contribute to a mission** or social impact that we believe in; to explore **new design, strategic, or technical approaches**; or, ideally, all of the above.

    If you have a great idea that meets these criteria, but you’re having trouble finding the support you need, we’d love to hear from you. Drop us a line at [getstarted@bivee.co](mailto:getstarted@givee.co).
