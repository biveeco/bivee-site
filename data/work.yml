# the list of projects and their metadata
# -> used to construct pages for each case study, based on 'project' template and markdown files in 'work' folders
# -> title.long is the main headline for the case study, and should be descriptive/editorial
# -> title.short is a short version of the title used to refer to the project in the UI/navigation. Usually just the project name (e.g. PPP Knowledge Lab) is good.
# -> title.subtitle is a descriptive/editorial subhead that should be displayed on the case study page. This is helpful if the client logo and long title don't make the project name obvious.

  title: Pro-bono work
  body: |-
    Bivee regularly does pro-bono work as a way to support missions we care about. We find it’s also a great way to build new relationships, explore exciting new ideas, and learn about new contexts. We're currently able to schedule 3 pro-bono projects each year, and we choose projects based on these criteria:

    - The project can be completed, from green-light to final approval, within a budget of 50 hours.
    - The project is an opportunity to contribute to a mission or idea that we believe in; to explore new design, strategic, or technical approaches; or, ideally, all of the above.
    - When we're done, we can write about the project and publicly share our work.

    If you have a great idea that meets these criteria, we’d love to hear from you. Drop us a line at [getstarted@bivee.co](mailto:getstarted@givee.co).
