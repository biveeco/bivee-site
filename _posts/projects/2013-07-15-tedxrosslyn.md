The Symposium Magazine project involved the development of an online magazine site that would allow academics to contribute new articles and foster a discussion around key topics of interest. The site was built with responsive design in mind and allows for easy viewing of content on a tablet or mobile device.  The site also compiles curated content that is automatically pulled from a variety of selected external sources.
