Arsham has a master's degree in computer science and over ten years of experience developing applications for web, mobile, and desktop use. He has a strong understanding of how to scale and build robust applications that perform well in low-bandwidth contexts. He architected and implemented several systems managing the data and interactions of over 100,000 volunteers, staff members, and government employees while at the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee. He continued his large scale systems development while working with PSI to help create its online University, implementing a custom single-sign-on system between Moodle and Drupal. Arsham was entered into the Computer Graphics hall of fame at UBC for his work on game engine development. He also engineered a hybrid Linux kernel application to conduct precise timing and energy measurements of speed scaling systems using only modern systems, without the need for expensive ancillary equipment. Some of this work was presented and published at the IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS).
