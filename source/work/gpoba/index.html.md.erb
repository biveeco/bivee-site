GPOBA was looking to reposition itself in the development finance sector as a center of expertise, align its communication strategy around a cohesive identity, and create an engagement plan for target audiences. We mapped stakeholders along with their needs while conducting workshops and exercises to identify gaps in internal and external communication. We discovered that, internally, staff were not consistent in communicating the value of GPOBA.

To address this gap, we developed a guidebook to help train staff and external GPOBA champions on how to talk about the organisation. We placed a significant emphasis on storytelling in GPOBA’s communications— telling the “story” of GPOBA for donor agencies who needed to showcase the organisation’s value to their governing bodies. In addition to clarifying the communication needs of donors, we developed a storytelling structure to make stories easier to draft, replicate, and share.
