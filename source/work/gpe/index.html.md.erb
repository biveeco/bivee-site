In October 2018, we  completed an engagement with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) to develop a strategy for knowledge and information sharing across developing country partners in the education sector. Comprised of funding mechanisms, partnership networks, and technical frameworks, the resulting strategy will support the capacity of local actors to exchange good practices on and enact meaningful education sector plans.

Our work also included recruiting, evaluating and recommending a grant agent for the US$80 million fund, as well as advising the grant agent to develop its program proposal.
