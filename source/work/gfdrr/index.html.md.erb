We’ve provided design, layout, and editing services to a number of GFDRR’s publications, often in time-constrained situations. We designed and implemented a system using a modified version of HTML and Markdown that allows authors and editors to work on written content online in tandem with our graphic design process.

  sizes: [800, 1200, 1600, 2000],
  padding: { top: "wide" },
  caption: "Report covers"
} %>

By resolving underlying content management and workflow issues, we were able to focus on understanding GFDRR’s positioning and communications objectives creating the brand guidelines and framework to be used across various GFDRR reports.
