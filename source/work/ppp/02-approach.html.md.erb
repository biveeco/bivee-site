Due to the number of organisations involved in curating and sharing PPP resources, we developed communications tools and materials to keep all teams engaged and updated on progress. To engage stakeholders on a personal level and draw individual feedback, we also conducted interviews and facilitated sessions.  This communication network served as a feedback loop to build buy-in and incorporate ideas from different teamsâ€™ perspectives. 

Insights from engagement activities factored into a revised strategy that better met the needs of stakeholders. We learned that the end product needed to account for thousands of files, contracts, and resources from different partners that could be tracked and managed by their various sites. To address this, we refocused the project from its initial system-centric approach to one that showcased the collaboration between contributors. 

The new approach included the implementation of two central technologies for storage and sharing. The Knowledge Library is a repository that provides a single area for knowledge documents to be managed, curated, and delivered to third-party websites. Drawing from the Library is the Knowledge Lab, the hub where knowledge around PPPs is surfaced and shared across institutions and with the general public, which also provides context for the resources pulled from the Library.
