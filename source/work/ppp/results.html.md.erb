Upon completion of the PPP Knowledge suite, our team was invited to aid with the launch of the sites at PPP Days in London. The PPP Knowledge Lab was highlighted and launched at the conference during a session dedicated to Knowledge Platforms. Integration with other Knowledge Initiatives across additional organizations is ongoing.

The PPIAF site redesign successfully showcased how the organization fosters conditions for infrastructure projects, while also highlighting its connection to the PPP Knowledge Lab initiative and resources.
