Upon completion of the PPP Knowledge suite, our team was invited to aid with the launch of the sites at [PPP Days 2015](http://www.ebrd.com/news/events/publicprivate-partnerships-ppp-days.html) in London. The PPP Knowledge Lab was highlighted and launched at the conference during a session dedicated to Knowledge Platforms. 

Since its launch, the PPP Knowledge Lab has been continuously updated with new resources, which are highlighted on the Bank's [social media accounts](https://twitter.com/wbg_ppp) and in sector-specific publications. Integration with other Knowledge Initiatives across additional organizations is ongoing.

The PPIAF site redesign successfully showcased how the organization fosters conditions for infrastructure projects, while also highlighting its connection to the PPP Knowledge Lab initiative and resources.
