One of the critical initial considerations of this project was the multiplicity of organizations and contributing teams involved in the PPP knowledge-development process. To make sure everyone’s voice was heard and informed, we developed communications tools and materials to keep all teams engaged and updated on progress. This communication network also served as a feedback loop to build stakeholder buy-in and incorporate ideas from a variety of perspectives.

From these preliminary communications, we developed a revised strategy that shifted the direction from the PPP CCSA’s original conceptual track. This strategy better met the needs of the stakeholders and refocused the project from a strictly systems-oriented perspective toward a solution that showcased the collaboration between the different stakeholders.

This initial revision included the implementation of three technologies:

+ The [Knowledge Library](https://library.pppknowledgelab.org/) is a repository that provides a single area for knowledge documents to be managed, curated, and delivered to third-party websites.
+ The [Knowledge Lab](https://pppknowledgelab.org/) is the central hub where knowledge around PPPs is surfaced and shared across institutions and with the general public. It provides context and metadata for the resources pulled from the Central API.
+ The [Handshake Journal](https://www.handshakejournal.org) is a magazine publication with contributors from a variety of private- and public-sector institutions that encourages conversation around issues in PPPs. The Handshake website was developed to provide easy access and readability to audiences in developing countries with low-bandwidth situations.
