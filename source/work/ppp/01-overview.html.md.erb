The World Bank Group’s Public-Private Partnerships Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (PPP CCSA) is both a beautiful acronym and a leader in PPP knowledge. As a part of the Bank, they manage resources on PPPs contributed by other thought leaders in the field, including the Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, PPIAF, and the PPPIRC. 

This isn’t an easy task, since data and learnings from these resources cut across different industries, projects, and countries. In order to share the necessary information while attributing the hard work put in to the rightful contributors the PPP CCSA needed a new solution: a collection of sites and resources to share and highlight contributions and contributors.
