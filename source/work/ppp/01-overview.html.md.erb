The use of public-private partnerships to design, build and deliver infrastructure worldwide has grown significantly in the past decade. Yet the availability of reliable information to help governments and advisors design and deliver projects well, has lagged behind.

The PPP Knowledge Lab is the first collaboration among the major multilateral development agencies to curate comprehensive online knowledge and resources on public-private partnerships (PPPs).

We were brought in to make this vision a reality by conceptualizing the platform, its strategy, design, development and protocols, and oversee its launch an event held at EBRD in London called PPP Days.
