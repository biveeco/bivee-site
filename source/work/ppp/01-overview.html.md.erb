The World Bank Groupâ€™s Public-Private Partnerships Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (PPP CCSA) is the clearinghouse for information around public-private partnerships (PPPs), with resources being contributed by the Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, PPIAF, and the PPPIRC. 

In order to streamline resource access and sharing, we partnered with the PPP CCSA to create a collection of sites and resources to serve as the leading edge of PPP knowledge.
