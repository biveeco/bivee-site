The World Bank Groupâ€™s Public-Private Partnerships Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (PPP CCSA) is the clearinghouse for resources around public-private partnerships (PPPs), a collection produced by collaborative efforts of the Inter-American Development Bank (FOMIN), Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, PPIAF, and the PPPIRC.

We partnered with the the PPP CCSA to showcase this knowledge by developing a collection of sites comprising the leading edge of PPP thought and knowledge, culminating in a central PPP Knowledge Lab.
