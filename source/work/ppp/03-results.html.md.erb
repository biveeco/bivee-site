The PPP Knowledge Suite was launched in London at [PPP Days 2015](http://www.ebrd.com/news/events/publicprivate-partnerships-ppp-days.html){:target="_blank"}, and new contributions are made regularly by partner institutions. Integration with knowledge initiatives from other organisations is ongoing. You can learn more about PPPs by looking through the [Knowledge Lab](https://pppknowledgelab.org/){:target="_blank"} or visiting the [Library](https://library.pppknowledgelab.org/){:target="_blank"} to check out the developer documentation.
