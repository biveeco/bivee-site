### Lightweight & extensible

To make the learning experience as seamless and effortless as possible, we designed the technology to get out of the way of the learners. We designed the platform to be able to respond to three types of courses: Self-paced, Cohort-based, and Workshop-based. We architected the platform to provide data analysis on learning, offer white-labelling and allow for learner data to be portable so that their data travels with them as they switch organizations.

### Offline access

No shortcuts were taken. To build an app that is simple, enjoyable, and fast, we envisioned a new strategy for cross-platform mobile app development. We ran a design workshop in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania with users and partners to really design and focus on the needs of Gateway Academyâ€™s target users.
We learned that most users would benefit from being able to take courses on their phones. Access to computers is usually only available at the place of work, but all learners had smart phones and limited data plans. Learners also wanted to learn on their commute, and in response we designed both an offline and mobile experience.

### Two native apps, less code

We developed iOS and Android simultaneously. In order to speed up development and reduce maintenance, we created a shared layer of business logic for all platforms. So when we have to make a change, it updates across every platform.
