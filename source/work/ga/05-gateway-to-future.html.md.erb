### Incubation and spin-off

Gateway Academy was always planned to spin-off and become its own organizations. From the initial design we planned for Gateway Academy to become its own, financially viable organization. We led the design of the business model, advising on expansion strategy, fundraising and set up of the Board of Advisors. Currently, Gateway Academy is raising $10 million from strategic donors and looking at further expansions globally.
