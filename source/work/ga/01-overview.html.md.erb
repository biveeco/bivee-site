The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Mastercard Foundation (MCF) work together to improve access to financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2016, the partnership tackled the issue at the institution level by creating an online learning academy for those working in financial services. By connecting local staff to online training programs from a variety of providers, banks and financial institutions would build their teamsâ€™ knowledge and skills around financial inclusion to benefit the communities they served.
