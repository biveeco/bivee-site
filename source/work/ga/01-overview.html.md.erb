The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Mastercard Foundation (MCF) work together to improve financial inclusion around the world. In 2016, the partnership expanded their work in Sub-Saharan Africa through an online learning initiative connecting financial institutions with training opportunities. By building the capacity of their staff through e-learning courses, financial service providers will be better equipped to promote financial inclusion the region. 

We partnered with Humentum and Paradem to develop Gateway Academy to accomplish the partnershipâ€™s goals.
