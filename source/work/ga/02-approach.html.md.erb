We partnered with Humentum (learning experts) and Paradem (tech experts) to develop and launch Gateway Academy (GA, for character count’s sake). From the project’s weeklong kickoff at our DC office, we’ve worked closely with CGAP to form one project team, doing our best to work across time zones spanning Seattle to Nairobi. Throughout the development process, members of the GA team have engaged external consultants and stakeholders, both virtually and on-location in GA’s first roll-out countries (Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia). Despite being spread around the world, we’ve been able to make sure that everyone feels ownership of, and excited about, GA and the prospects it brings by communicating openly and actively involving users in the development process.

We developed a three-phase approach to the development and roll-out of Gateway Academy. In the primary Demo phase, we analysed the current training market for financial services in the region and conducted design workshops with financial service providers to facilitate discussion around e-learning needs and current practices. From here, we developed the first iteration of Gateway Academy’s cloud-based online learning platform (including options for accessibility in low-bandwidth contexts) and onboarded training service providers and learners.
