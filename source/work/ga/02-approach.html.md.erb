From the very beginning, we’ve worked closely with the CGAP team, external consultants, and stakeholders on-location in the target countries (Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia). The project began with a kickoff meeting to identify a shared vision of success and develop a project roadmap, which consisted of three major phases: Demo, Beta, and Launch.

The Demo phase involved: a landscape analysis of the current training market for financial services and within financial service providers; design and collaboration workshops with financial service providers to facilitate discussion around e-learning needs and current practices; the development of Gateway Academy’s cloud-based online learning platform, which can be accessed in low-bandwidth contexts; and the onboarding of training service providers and future learners to the platform.
