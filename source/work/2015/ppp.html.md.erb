Why: Desired to develop a central place to store the body of knowledge around PPP’s. The source of this knowledge was established as a collaborative effort across the Inter-American Development Bank (FOMIN), Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, PPIAF, and the PPPIRC. The end result desired was to have a collection of sites and resources that would comprise the leading edge thought and knowledge around PPP’s.

## Design
<%= image_tag lorem.image('800x400') %>
Given the wide variety of partners and stakeholders involved, our team interviewed key stakeholders and revised the implementation strategy to align with the broader mission and objective of the PPP CCSA and its partners. This included the implementation of three technologies which had to meet the requirements of the World Bank Group’s broader security protocols.

## Do

API = Thousands of files, documents, contracts, and resources had to be tracked and managed by various sites. The issue around how these resources would be managed, and how to reduce duplication of work became the central focus of the technology component of the project. Built on Ruby on Rails, the Central Repository provides a single area for knowledge documents to be managed and curated, then delivered to third-party websites. The delivery is platform agnostic so that documents can be searched and surfaced across any web technology or application. 

KL = The Knowledge Lab is the central area where the Knowledge around PPP’s are surfaced and shared. Built upon a multi-organization Reference Guide for PPP’s, the PPP Knowledge Lab provides context for the resources pulled from the API, as well as other resources from partner organizations. The website was developed on a custom Drupal website. [ The visual identity of the Knowledge Lab was calibrated to the site’s precise informative goals, yet interacts with other websites in the PPP family in a familiar manner. This allows the audience to truly understand the core WBG culture and values linking the Knowledge Lab to the other members of the PPP network. ]

Handshake = The Handshake Journal is a magazine publication aimed at discussing and providing commentary on topics on PPP’s. The Handshake website was developed to provide easy access and readability in developing countries with low bandwidth situations,  and provide an experience similar to reading a magazine. The website was developed on Wordpress and is uniquely designed to be intuitively navigated without a traditional navigation bar. [The IFC enlisted our team to develop the digital presence of their printed publication, the Handshake Journal. The final product is an online magazine with a consistent readable format that will provide regular case studies and showcase PPP best practice. Using WordPress, the site presents a variety of content from various industry experts, including articles, blog posts, and interviews. This virtual presence allows for the creation of a unique identity for the Handshake Journal yet relates its mission to the knowledge expansion key to the development of inter-industry and public-private partnership understandings. ]

PPIAF/PPIRC = Other websites are in the process of development for PPIAF and PPPIRC to utilize the Central API as a core component of linking too, and disseminating PPP Knowledge. Both sites will be developed on Drupal.

What we did it with: Ruby on Rails

Who benefited/what happened: Our team was invited to aid with the Launch of the sites at PPP Days in London. The site was highlighted and launched at the conference with a session dedicated to Knowledge Platforms. Integration with other Knowledge Initiatives across other organizations is ongoing.
