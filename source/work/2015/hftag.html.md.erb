## Design
<%= image_tag lorem.image('800x400') %>
To begin the process, numerous documents and articles from across the HF-TAG network were secured and centralized.  Files were stored and managed through Dropbox for ease of use and accessibility to multiple users. These were then automatically synchronized and categorized accordingly on the knowledge management system, allowing for efficient location. 

Each document and article links to a relevant community of practice.  These communities are made up of specialists in the HFTAG’s member organizations and foster discussion and collaboration around how to best use a given document. Files occupy their own individual pages, which display specific metadata about the document as well as related discussions from the community of practice.
In order to continue their involvement with a specific topic of interest, users have the option to sign up for ongoing newsletters, and customized HTML emails can be sent to the site’s members. Built using Ruby on Rails and Wordpress, the site features responsive design and allows users from different continents to access the site and its resources from a variety of devices. 

What we did it with: Ruby on Rails, Ember MVC Javascript framework, Postgres SQL, Wordpress, MySQL, jQuery, Dropbox, MailChimp, EventBrite
