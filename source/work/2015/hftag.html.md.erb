<!-- introduction? -->

HF-TAG, a consortium of stakeholders including UNICEF and GAIN, sought to create a platform and community to allow global experts in home fortification and nutrition to share their work and knowledge with others. 


<!-- phases -->

## Understand

<!-- Would these go under "Do" as they refer to deliverables rather than the consultation process?-->
Preliminary data collection. Documents and articles from across the HF-TAG network were secured and centralized. Files were stored and managed through Dropbox for ease of use and accessibility to multiple users collaborating on this phase of development. These were then automatically synchronized and categorized accordingly on the knowledge management system, allowing for efficient location when the system was complete.

Determined next steps resulting from information gained in Understand phase. Each document and article links to a relevant community of practice.  These communities are made up of specialists in the HFTAG’s member organizations and foster discussion and collaboration around how to best use a given document. Files occupy their own individual pages, which display specific metadata about the document as well as related discussions from the community of practice.
In order to continue their involvement with a specific topic of interest, users have the option to sign up for ongoing newsletters, and customized HTML emails can be sent to the site’s members. Built using Ruby on Rails and Wordpress, the site features responsive design and allows users from different continents to access the site and its resources from a variety of devices.

Who benefited/what happened: Observable buy-in, successful interaction of users and contributors across different disciplines within organizations and across the globe.  Streamlined file / information access and organization; facilitation of greater interaction amongst members. Recent implementation of an interactive calendar has promoted communication through the visibility of webinars and events.  This allows members of the knowledge community to sign up for events and manage attendance. Each member can be messaged and contacted for follow-up regarding lessons learned from the webinars.
