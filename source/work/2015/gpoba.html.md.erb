## Design
<%= image_tag lorem.image('800x400') %>
What we did: Through collaboration with and consultation from the GPOBA team, best solution was identified: web development of static site to display content in straightforward format akin to the way in which the report was written. Additional request for accompanying print publication meant switching timelines and working against unexpected deadline to provide the same accessibility of info in a different media format.

Needed to create consistency between two types of content (web vs print) while changes to the final copy were still being made by client team. The resulting = ability of donors / partners / stakeholders / audience to easily view the impacts of GPOBA throughout the year and in individual projects. Changes incorporated through Github allowed the collaboration process to be streamlined (see GAR15 case study).

## Do

Technology used: Indesign, Git, Ruby on Rails, Middleman, HTML5, CSS <!-- (+ others) -->

Who benefited/what happened: Git process showed ways for improvement but also highlighted ability of team to work under pressure against so many unexpected changes in content/deadline/etc.  The resulting report, in both print and web format, was well-received by the stakeholder community and the GPOBA team alike.  Future work to expand identity development to a comprehensive website and template collection is planned. The full report website can be viewed at http://www.gpoba.org/2015ar/. <!-- Services included stakeholder analysis, identity development, web design, web development, graphic and chart formation, print report design, typesetting, content migration, photo editing and procurement, and revisions. -->
