## Design

What we did: Web development of static site that would display content in straightforward format akin to the way in which the report was written. Unexpected / last-minute / emergency / urgent(?) request for accompanying print publication meant switching timelines and working against unexpected deadline to procure the same accessibility of info in a different media format. Had to create consistency between two types of content (web vs print) while changes to the final copy were still being made by client team. [ Our team was tasked with designing a website that would present GPOBA’s achievements in 2015, primarily to their donor audience. Through a design process involving collaboration and consultation from the GPOBA team, a static site was developed to display the contents of the group’s annual report in an inviting and informative way. The project then evolved to include the creation of a printed report for the same content. The printed report maintained the style of the website, but with its own template that told the story of GPOBA’s yearly accomplishments in a tangible format. ]

Why we did it: Ability of donors / partners / stakeholders / audience to easily view the impacts of GPOBA throughout the year and in individual projects. Changes incorporated through Github allowed the collaboration process to be streamlined (see GAR15).

What we did it with: Indesign, Git, Ruby on Rails, Middleman, HTML5, CSS(+more)

Who benefited/what happened: Git process showed ways for improvement but also highlighted ability of team to work under pressure against so many unexpected changes in content/deadline/etc. Potential for GPOBA website collaboration? 

The resulting report, in both print and web format, was well-received by the stakeholder community and the GPOBA team alike.  Future work to expand identity development to a comprehensive website and template collection is planned.  
Services included stakeholder analysis, identity development, web design, web development, graphic and chart formation, print report design, typesetting, content migration, photo editing and procurement, and revisions.
