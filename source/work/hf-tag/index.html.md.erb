HF-TAG, a consortium of stakeholders including UNICEF and GAIN, needed to consolidate and make accessible its breadth of global development resources. The outcome of the project needed to connect repositories of knowledge across four major organisations to allow for the availability and interaction of different materials and experts across the globe.

We created a platform for knowledge sharing and community development around specialised topics. This project connected repositories of knowledge across four organisations on one platform and was built responsively using Ruby on Rails and Wordpress. An interactive calendar allows members of the knowledge community to sign up for events and manage attendance. Members can be messaged and contacted for follow-up regarding lessons learned.
