"Forcibly Displaced", the flagship publication of the partnership between the WBG GPFD and the UNHCR, sought to bring the issue of involuntary migration to the attention of new audiences. The publication required its own unique identity in the form of communications materials and a branding campaign, given its high profile. We worked closely with the newly formed Forced Displacement GP and with World Bank ECR teams to coordinate the launch.

We kept the design extremely minimal in order to stand out from other publications that often are heavy on graphics and photography. The end result was a striking design that was well-received by the team. Our team also produced a selection of branded communications products, including short informational briefs, and worked closely with WBG Communications for the launch.
