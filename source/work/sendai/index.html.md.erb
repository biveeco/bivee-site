The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a global partnership that helps developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerabilities to natural hazards. Our team facilitated the initial concept, layout process, and design for GFDRR's "Investing in Resilience" infographic brochure used during the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan. These infographics were designed for reuse and long-term use for other assets such as additional reports, Powerpoint presentations, and interactive web content.

The subject of the report was highly technical but the audience &mdash; consisting mostly of policy-makers &mdash; did not necessarily have in-depth technical knowledge. To keep the content accessible to non-experts, we refined and distilled the main messages in a series of collaborative workshops, convering design, branding, and content-modelling aspects. Our work helped establish a framework on which GFDRR has built some of its overall brand profiles and key messaging today. The report itself was widely acclaimed, bringing attention to GFDRRâ€™s work and expertise to a much wider audience.
