Handshake is a quarterly magazine telling the real stories behind public-private partnerships. The traditional print publication had a niche audience, but as the PPP CCSA planned to roll out its new online knowledge hub, there was an opportunity to expand Handshake’s impact.

We broadened Handshake’s appeal in tandem with this rollout by developing a branding system and online component for the magazine in the form of a WordPress website and content management system. This new system also allowed staff to make updates as-needed to content and add new materials upon their publication.

Tanya Scobie Oliveira was the founding editor-in-chief in both print and digital format, providing all art and editorial direction.
