The Bank has over 10,000 employees with varying uses for development data. Our team engaged Bank staff and management in a series of qualitative knowledge collection activities to identify the range of end users’ needs relating to development data. This research involved over 550 stakeholder interactions, including  workshops, surveys and interviews of both internal stakeholders and external development data specialists. Feedback was collected from members of each of the Bank’s sub-units and supplemented by industry best-practice research and analysis of similar initiatives at other international organisations.

We placed people at the center of strategy development to ensure our conclusions functioned in practice. Our conversations with stakeholders allowed us to understand both the day-to-day and long-term processes and needs of individuals, teams, and sectors in terms of data usage and interaction. These insights took th the form of strategy and structure recommendations for a future Development Data Hub accompanied by a series of recommendations for an effective knowledge-sharing, analysis, and cross-collaboration environment for development data users.
