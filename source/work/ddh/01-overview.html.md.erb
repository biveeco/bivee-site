With over 10,000 employees working to solve development issues around the world, the World Bank has accumulated its fair share of development data over the last seventy-plus years. Yet there was no process for communicating what data existed, where to find it, or who was responsible for maintaining archives— meaning a lot of work was duplicated or impaired. To simplify the ability of Bank staff to do their jobs, we partnered with SecondMuse and the Bank’s Development Data and Economics Group (DECDG) to develop a strategy for better development data curation, sharing, and maintenance.
