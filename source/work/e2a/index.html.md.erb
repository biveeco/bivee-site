We partnered with Evidence to Action and Pathfinder International to develop a tool for adolescent and youth reproductive health planning. The tool was designed for use by governments, organisations, and individuals who needed information to make family planning plans more responsive to the reproductive health needs of young people.

The tool evaluates inputs from partners in the field to inform a user whether their plan meets guidelines for their sector and state. Development of the tool, including features and visual function, were informed by a series of meeting with the E2A and Pathfinder teams in DC as well as focus groups in the field conducted by the E2A team.
