In 2016, Bivee team member Christie Mangir was diagnosed with breast cancer. In order to manage her symptoms during treatment, Bivee co-founder Nicholas Kingston  developed an app to track her data. The Bivee team incubated the concept, which spun off into Tela in 2017. 

Tela integrates research-grade patient-generated health data into clinical care and research.

Patient-generated health data is collected through validated physical and psychosocial measures and integrated into clinical workflow, allowing providers to review summary reports prior to patient appointments. The free app empowers patients to easily track their symptoms, medications, and psychosocial wellness to inform their care team, improve their treatment, and accelerate research.

[Tela](https://tela.app) is translated into Spanish and French and is available on iOS and Android devices.
