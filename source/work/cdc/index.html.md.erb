We developed a platform for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to manage interactions and knowledge sharing around micronutrient survey resources. The platform allows for interactive discussions about best practices and usage of documents, and user submissions of tested practices to the Toolkit increase the available body of knowledge and foster further investigations.

The Toolkit’s straightforward interface helps make a complicated framework of documents and files easy to find and manage for each user’s specific needs, regardless of bandwidth or network variations.
