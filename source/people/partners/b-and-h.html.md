Baker & Hill is a creative services and production company formed in 2000 by principals Clint Baker and Mark Hill. We joined forces to provide clients with unique, high-end, illustration and design for film, animation, infographics, and interactives to be shared via broadcast, digital, and social media. Simplifying a complex subject is what Baker & Hill does best. We develop visual communications that engage and educate. We know how to capture a viewer’s attention -- and hold it -- so information is better retained. Animation is an ideal way to appeal to a diverse audience and to transcend age, gender and cultural differences. Our team has used visual tools to explain tough topics like cancer to kids, to promote safer driving habits among teenagers, and to tout the benefits of third world assistance programs to global stakeholders. Baker & Hill’s clients include National Geographic, Discovery, National Park Service, PBS, Marriott, Hilton, Scientific American, The Washington Post, ABC, WETA, and the World Bank.
