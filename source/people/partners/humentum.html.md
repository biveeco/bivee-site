Humentum is a global membership association providing training, convening, and support. They work towards social good: managing compliance and risk, juggling finances, designing programs and helping people perform at their best. Humentum works across all project stakeholders – project beneficiaries, partners and donors – to help them deliver a tangible upscale in performance and results. For more than 40 years the organization has supported organizations as they address the world’s most pressing social issues. Humentum’s learning activities are designed to help organizations plan projects, strengthen decision-making, develop better systems and processes, and identify effective solutions to important challenges. Their training programs are modeled on the best practices in adult learning

Bivee and Humentum have partnered since the beginning 2017 to develop and launch [Gateway Academy](https://gateway.academy), an online learning platform for those working in financial services.
