Jay has worked in the design industry for 15 years in a broad range of roles, including art direction, interface design, publication design, print media, video, and motion graphics. He has co-directed short films for nonprofits, designed a takeover of Times Square subway station for several multi-million dollar promotional campaigns, and art-directed knowledge management interfaces for international development organizations. His work has appeared in the New York Times and Engadget, and has won DC-region Addy awards.

Jay developed both the art direction and information architecture for Population Services International’s innovative learning platform, “Worksmart,” which built real-time learning into the day-to-day operations of the organization. Jay has developed campaigns for Animal Planet, Discovery Communications, and has lead the design of the World Bank Group’s PPP Knowledge Lab. He also contributed to the development of Penn State’s online learning system’s interface, ELMS, and, as the lead designer at Bivee, guides the creation of intuitive, simple, and engaging brands, interfaces, and publications that guide change within organizations.
